Horiseon Challenge Week 1

My Challenge Work Process
    1. Cloned Repository
    2. Opened Challenged Guidelines
    3. Looked Over Code in index.html file
    4. Opened CSS Code
    5. Looked Over CSS Code in style.css file
    6 Consolidated lines

        A. Worked on shorting all <div> to:
            I. Class= 
                - benefit(s)
                - content
            II. <main>
            III. <section>
            IV. <aside>
            V. <nav>
            VI. <p>
            VII. <li>

        B. Made sure to use right syntex structure to have code be more presentable (cleaned up)
        C. Added Notes to each section using this structure: <!--blank-->
        E. Consolidated all repeating content 
        F. Made sure to replace all <div> syntex with changed html classes 
        G. Fixed the code to run liner to the html code for better line by line reading
            I. Explained changed with /*notes*/  
            II. Shorted all .text to their respected classes for easier reading
            III. Added Accessibility tags and hyperlinks to the code
